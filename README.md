# 🎵 Mood Tunes

**Mood Tunes** is a front-end-only music UI project built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, designed during my JavaScript learning phase. It categorizes music based on different moods like **Chill**, **Energetic**, **Romantic**, and more — providing a neat and responsive UI that visually reflects emotional tones.

This is a **practice project** without a database or backend integration.
